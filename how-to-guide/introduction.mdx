## What you need

Before creating your first project, make sure you have the following ready:

- The complete **RFP document** (PDF format)
- **Product datasheets** for all intended equipment
- **Exact model numbers** for each product
- **Bill of Materials** (Excel format), if available

<Info>
If your RFP is a scanned PDF, the system will process it using OCR. Structured tables and multi-level numbering formats are supported.
</Info>

## Preparation guidelines

- Ensure each datasheet corresponds to the exact product model you intend to propose.
- If a datasheet includes multiple variants, identify the correct model in advance.
- Do not run compliance before linking the correct SKUs in Scope.

<Warning>
Accurate inputs are essential for reliable compliance evaluation.
</Warning>

## Workflow overview

speXcompl.ai follows a structured compliance pipeline. Each stage builds on the previous one — skipping steps may affect accuracy.
