After running compliance, review the results before exporting.

## Check the summary

Use the summary counters at the top to identify:

- **Not Reviewed** items
- **Partially Compliant** items
- **Non-Compliant** items

Focus especially on partially and non-compliant requirements. For each one:

1. Review the reasoning
2. Check the referenced source pages
3. Verify the applied compliance status

<Note>
The confidence score reflects how certain the system is about the evaluation based on available evidence. **It does not represent percentage compliance.**
</Note>

## Validation checklist

Before moving forward, ensure:

- All relevant sections have been evaluated
- Compliance statuses are applied
- SKU selection is accurate

<Warning>
Compliance results provide structured, evidence-backed analysis, but final validation remains your responsibility.
</Warning>

<Check>
Once validated, proceed to [export the compliance report](/how-to-guide/export-report).
</Check>
