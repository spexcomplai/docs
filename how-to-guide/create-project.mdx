description: "Set up a compliance project by uploading your RFP, datasheets, and defining the Bill of Materials."

Every compliance evaluation begins with creating a project. A project groups together the RFP specification file, product datasheets, selected models, and compliance results.

## Start a new project

From the Dashboard, click **Create New Project**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-guide/create-new-project.png" alt="Create New Project button on the dashboard" />
</Frame>

Enter your project details:

- **Project Name** — a descriptive name to identify the project
- **Deadline** — optional, but recommended for tracking

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-guide/project-name-step.png" alt="Project Name dialog showing Step 1 of 6 with name and deadline fields" />
</Frame>

Click **Continue** to proceed.

## Upload the RFP document

Upload the complete RFP file in PDF format.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-guide/upload-rfp.png" alt="Upload RFP dialog showing Step 2 of 6 with a file drop zone for PDF files" />
</Frame>

Once uploaded, the system automatically begins extracting structured requirements, preserving:

- Parts
- Sections
- Subsections
- Clause numbering

This structure appears later in the RFP Viewer.

<Info>
If the RFP is scanned, OCR processing is applied automatically.
</Info>

Click **Continue** once the upload is complete.

## Upload product datasheets

Upload all relevant product datasheets for the equipment you intend to propose. You may upload multiple datasheets at once.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-guide/upload-datasheets.png" alt="Upload Datasheets dialog showing Step 3 of 6" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
Datasheets must correspond to the actual product models you plan to submit. If a datasheet includes multiple variants, you will specify the exact model later in the [Scope configuration step](/how-to-guide/configure-scope).
</Warning>

Click **Continue** after uploading.

## Define the Bill of Materials (BoM)

The Bill of Materials represents the product models you are planning to propose. It defines which specific models the system should check for compliance.

<Frame>

</Frame>

You can define the BoM in one of three ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upload Excel">
    Upload a BoM file in Excel format. The file must contain a column clearly identifying product models, such as:

    - SKU
    - Model / Models
    - Part Number
    - Item Number

    The system automatically detects models listed under that column.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-to-guide/excel-bom-example.png" alt="Excel spreadsheet with a Model Number column listing product SKUs" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Paste models">
    Paste product models directly into the BoM input box, one model per line. This method works well for smaller projects or when an Excel file is not available.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-to-guide/paste-skus.png" alt="Text input showing pasted SKU model numbers, one per line" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Define later">
    You may skip BoM definition during project creation. In this case, you must manually link each product model to its corresponding datasheet from the **Scope** tab before running compliance.

    See [Add or correct SKUs manually](/how-to-guide/configure-scope#add-or-correct-skus-manually) for details.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Important note on BoM

Compliance should not be executed until all intended product models are properly defined and linked. Defining the BoM ensures that:

- The correct datasheets are used
- The correct product variants are evaluated
- Compliance results reflect the intended proposal

## Project created

Your project is now created. The RFP is processed and structured, datasheets are ingested, and the project workspace is ready.

Next, [review the extracted requirements](/how-to-guide/review-requirements) before configuring Scope and running compliance.
