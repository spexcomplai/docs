Once extraction is verified and all SKUs are properly configured in Scope, you are ready to run compliance.

Before clicking **Check with AI**, confirm which SKUs are selected for each section or requirement tree. Compliance is always performed against the SKUs currently selected for that section.

## SKU selection per section

Each main section (for example, "2.2 Cameras") allows you to define which SKUs should be evaluated against its requirements.

</Frame>

By default:

- The main section is set to **All SKUs**
- Child items inherit this setting

You may override this by selecting specific SKUs for a full section, a subsection, or an individual requirement. This gives you fine-grained control over evaluation logic.

## SKU inheritance logic

The system uses an inheritance model:

| Parent setting | Child behavior |
| --- | --- |
| All SKUs | Children inherit all SKUs |
| Specific SKUs selected | Children inherit those specific SKUs |
| Override at child level | Child uses its own selection |

This structure enables precise control when different requirement groups apply to different product types.

For example:
- **Cameras section** — evaluate only camera SKUs
- **Server section** — evaluate only server SKUs

## Selecting multiple SKUs

You may select multiple SKUs for a single section or requirement tree. When multiple SKUs are selected:

- Compliance is executed against each selected SKU
- Results are generated per SKU
- This enables side-by-side comparison of products

This is particularly useful when comparing alternative models.

## Performance considerations

<Note>
Selecting all SKUs for every section may:
- Increase compliance processing time
- Produce a larger and more complex Excel export
- Include unnecessary evaluation results

For best performance and clarity, select only relevant SKUs per section. Avoid leaving all SKUs selected by default unless intentional.
</Note>

## Run the evaluation and review results

Once SKU selection is confirmed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Check with AI">
    Click the **Check with AI** button at the section or requirement level.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review compliance results">
    After processing, click any requirement to expand it and display:

    - Compliance result per selected SKU
    - Confidence score
    - Extracted reasoning
    - Source references with page numbers

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-to-guide/compliance-result-detail.png" alt="Expanded compliance result showing status, AI reasoning, source page references, and manual notes" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each selected SKU is evaluated independently. If multiple SKUs were selected, separate results are displayed for each one.

## Evidence and traceability

Each AI result includes:

- A summarized reasoning statement
- Direct references to source pages within the linked datasheet
- A confidence percentage

</Frame>

Clicking a source page navigates directly to the referenced location in the document. This ensures compliance decisions are evidence-backed and traceable.

<Warning>
The confidence percentage represents the system's confidence in the evaluation based on the clarity and strength of supporting evidence. **It does not represent percentage compliance.**

- A **higher** confidence score indicates clear alignment between the requirement and datasheet language.
- A **lower** confidence score may indicate ambiguity in wording, partial matches, or limited explicit evidence.

Always review the reasoning and referenced sources before applying the compliance status.
</Warning>
