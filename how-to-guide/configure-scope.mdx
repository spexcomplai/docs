Before running compliance evaluation, you must confirm that the correct SKUs are defined in Scope.

A **SKU** represents a specific product model you intend to propose. Each SKU corresponds to a single product variant that will be evaluated against the RFP requirements. The Scope defines which SKUs are included in the compliance check.

## Review scoped SKUs

If a Bill of Materials was uploaded or pasted during project creation, the system attempts to detect and match SKUs automatically.

At the top of the Scope page, you can see:

- **Total matched SKUs**
- **Number of uploaded datasheets**

Under **Scoped SKUs**, review the list and confirm:

- All intended SKUs are listed
- Each SKU is linked to the correct datasheet
- No required SKUs are missing

## Add or correct SKUs manually

If a SKU is missing or incorrectly matched, you can define it manually.

  <Step title="Select the appropriate datasheet" />
  <Step title="Enter the exact model number" />
  <Step title="Confirm the addition" />
</Steps>

If necessary, you may remove incorrect SKUs or clear the list and redefine them. Manual configuration ensures the correct product variant is evaluated during compliance.

<Warning>
Do not run compliance evaluation until:
- All intended SKUs are defined
- Each SKU is linked to the correct datasheet

Compliance results are calculated only against the SKUs currently in Scope.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Think of Scope as defining **what you are proposing**.

- The **RFP** defines what is required.
- The **SKUs** define what you are offering.
- **Compliance** compares the two.
